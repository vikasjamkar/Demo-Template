                The conventional commercial model for consulting where the
                advisory firms provide services to clients at little risk to its
                income stream continues to remain a source of frustration for
                the clients. The incumbent consulting firms often bear minimal
                ownership of delivery as primary risk of execution continues to
                reside with the client. For example, if the jointly designed
                strategies miss target deadlines, the engagement typically gets
                extended and the advisor benefits while the client bears the
                cost. This zero-sum commercial arrangement is ripe for an
                overhaul for high value strategic programs that bear significant
                risk for management.

                Lastly, the incumbent consulting firms largely conduct
                engagement activities at an arms-length with limited client
                involvement. Consultancies prefer this approach to safeguard
                their proprietary methodologies constraining the client
                management teams' ability to learn and upskill during
                engagements. As such, this perpetuates a commercial cycle that
                allows these firms to address similar issues repeatedly without
                empowering the client to address these challenges in the future.
