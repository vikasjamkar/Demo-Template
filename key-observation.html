              We are at a pivotal junction of digital advancement wherein
              Artificial Intelligence is advancing exponentially, while the
              barriers to accessing this technological advancement is
              diminishing. Machine learning and Al tools are creating profound
              shifts in the data analytics landscape:
            </p>
            <ul class="custom-list-dark">
              <li>Accelerated velocity</li>
              <li>Enhanced accuracy</li>
              <li>Cost efficiencies</li>
              <li>Predictive capabilities</li>
              <li>Increased accessibility</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              We believe that Al tools will continue along the maturity curve
              reducing the reliance on human intervention in data analytics.
              Given that Advisory firms primarily differentiate themselves in
              their ability to deliver unique analytics through "human"
              expertise, these incumbents will be forced to re-design
              organizational structures, delivery models and commercial
              arrangements.

              Today's institutions are facing unprecedented competition and
              disruption to their existing business models and in need for
              some much needed "practical" advice. However, majority of the
              "premier consultancies" find themselves unequipped to provide
              such practical advice due to lack of diversified operational
              expertise amongst their ranks. Instead, these institutions are
              primarily "selling" static or obsolete frameworks whereas the
              clients are demanding actionable insights.

                The conventional commercial model for consulting where the
                advisory firms provide services to clients at little risk to its
                income stream continues to remain a source of frustration for
                the clients. The incumbent consulting firms often bear minimal
                ownership of delivery as primary risk of execution continues to
                reside with the client. For example, if the jointly designed
                strategies miss target deadlines, the engagement typically gets
                extended and the advisor benefits while the client bears the
                cost. This zero-sum commercial arrangement is ripe for an
                overhaul for high value strategic programs that bear significant
                risk for management.

            <div class="tab-nav-info" id="tab04">
              <p>
                Lastly, the incumbent consulting firms largely conduct
                engagement activities at an arms-length with limited client
                involvement. Consultancies prefer this approach to safeguard
                their proprietary methodologies constraining the client
                management teams' ability to learn and upskill during
                engagements. As such, this perpetuates a commercial cycle that
                allows these firms to address similar issues repeatedly without
                empowering the client to address these challenges in the future.
